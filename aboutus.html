			<p>We bake high-end cakes and cupcakes and everything is baked to order using the finest ingredients.
			We also use fresh fruits, excellent quality Madagascar vanilla and Belgian chocolate and Satin Ice fondant.  
			We also believe in buying Irish and local products and endeavour to use as many as possible.</p>
			<p>Our menu will include a wide variety of flavours, vanilla, lemon, strawberry, chocolate, coffee, 
			red velvet, carrot, mint chocolate, orange chocolate, maple, apple and cinnamon, and lime and coconut 
			to name a few. Fab Cake Studio will also offer the customer the choice to theme their cake or cupcake.</p>
			<p>Not only do our sweets and cakes taste great, but they are uniquely and artistically made for all occasions.  
			We bake our cakes totally from scratch, using the finest ingredients. We are an advocate of natural and healthy 
			elements so we do not use box mixes.</p>
			<p>Our buttercreams are Swiss Meringue  based which are made from pure butter and fresh egg whites. Swiss Meringue 
			gives cake a silky and smooth texture you can not resist! Unlike shortening based frostings.</p>
			<p>Most of our cakes are covered with a rich coat of chocolate ganache made from Belgium chocolate and fresh cream.
			Not only does this give cake a rich and delicious taste, but it also helps keep it moist longer!</p>
			<p>It is important that our products not only taste delicious but also look appealing and attractive to the eye.</p>
			<p>We deliver a high-end, well presented product and use the finest ingredients. Our cakes and cupcakes will delight
			the customer and make celebrations a moment to cherish.</p>
			<p>We can provide a cake that is different, fun, colourful, a cake in the shape of a football or themed with your children's
			favourite character! Fab Cake Studio can provide cupcakes and cakes for birthdays, christenings, weddings an
			all your special occasions.</p>
